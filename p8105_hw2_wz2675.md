# Problem 1

## Part 1

First, let’s tidy the `pols-month.csv` file.

``` r
pols_month = 
  read_csv("Data/pols-month.csv") |>
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day")) |> 
  mutate(month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)],
         year = as.numeric(year),
         president = ifelse(prez_gop == 1, "gop", "dem")) |> 
  select(-prez_gop, -prez_dem, -day)
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...
    ## date (1): mon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

## Part 2

Secondly, let’s tidy up `snp.csv` file.

``` r
snp =
  read_csv("Data/snp.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%y"),
         date = as.Date(ifelse(date > Sys.Date(),
                               format(date, "19%y-%m-%d"),
                               format(date)))) |> 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day")) |> 
  mutate(month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)],
         year = as.numeric(year)) |> 
  select(-day) |> 
  arrange(year, month)
```

    ## Rows: 787 Columns: 2
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): date
    ## dbl (1): close
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

## Part 3

Thirdly, let’s tidy up `unemployment.csv` file.

``` r
unemployment =
  read_csv("Data/unemployment.csv") |> 
  pivot_longer(Jan:Dec,
               names_to = "month",
               values_to = "unemployment_per") |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

## Part 4

Finally, combine all three tidied files into one large, tidy file.

``` r
pols_snp =
  left_join(pols_month, snp, by = c("year", "month"))
fivethirtyeight = 
  left_join(pols_snp, unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))
```

The data set above we manipulate are all come from “FiveThirtyEight”
data. For the `pols-month.csv` data, it includes the date of the record
and status of 822 politicians at that time. It states whether these
politicians are republican or democratic. Whether they are governors,
senators, or representatives. For the `snp.csv` files, it includes the
date of the record and the Standard & Poor’s stock market index at that
date. For `unemployment.csv`, it includes the percentage of unemployment
in each month in associate years. All three data have a range from
approximately 1950s to 2015. The resulting data set including 822
observations and 12 variables from three data set we joint together.
There exist some NA values, which resulting from different data set we
joint lack some of the data in specific years. So, we need to omit some
data points from the data set if we are looking for specific patterns or
making plots.

# Problem 2

``` r
mr_trash_wheel =
  read_excel("data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
             sheet = 1,
             range = cell_cols("A:N")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons * 500 / 30,
         year = as.numeric(year),
         brand = "Mr. Trash")
```

``` r
professor_trash_wheel = 
  read_excel("data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
             sheet = 2,
             range = cell_cols("A:M")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons * 500 / 30,
         brand = "Professor Trash")
```

``` r
gwynnda_trash_wheel = 
  read_excel("data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
             sheet = 4,
             range = cell_cols("A:K")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(homes_powered = weight_tons * 500 / 30,
         brand = "Gwynnda Trash") |> 
  na.omit()
```

``` r
mr_professor =
  full_join(mr_trash_wheel, professor_trash_wheel)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons,
    ## volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts,
    ## glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags, homes_powered, brand)`

``` r
trash_wheel_df =
  full_join(mr_professor, gwynnda_trash_wheel)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons,
    ## volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts,
    ## homes_powered, brand)`

``` r
july_2021_cigbutts = 
  gwynnda_trash_wheel |> 
  filter(month == "July" & year == 2021) |> 
  select(cigarette_butts)
july_2021_cigbutts = sum(july_2021_cigbutts)
```

From the final data set I combine, there are in total 749 observations.
On average, the `homes_powered` variable represent the number of home
powered trash wheel. Comparing three different trash wheel, the most
home powered trash wheel is Mr. Trash wheel, which in total have 29139
home powered wheels. The total weight of trash that collected by
Professor Trash Wheel is 190.12 tons. The total number of cigarette
butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021 is 1.63^{4}
